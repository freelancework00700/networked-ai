            these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or
            transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
            terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further,
            this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such
            agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and
            Networked LLC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a className action. Your rights will be determined by a

            Networked LLC is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and
            to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at

            <a href="mailto:admin&#64;net-worked.ai" class="a" target="_blank">admin&#64;net-worked.ai</a>. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a
            party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice
            to Networked LLC should be sent to Networked LLC, 297 East Paces Ferry Rd. Ne. N307, Atlanta, Georgia 30305, United States (“Notice
            Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If
            Networked LLC and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Networked LLC may
            commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Networked LLC or you will not be
            disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Networked LLC is entitled.

          <div class="body-14M"><b>d. Arbitration Procedures</b></div>
          <div class="body-12M">
            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and
            procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For
            information on the AAA, please visit its website, >
            <a href="http://www.adr.org/" class="a" target="_blank"> https://www.adr.org </a>. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer
            disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
            <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer" class="a" target="_blank"> https://www.adr.org/consumer </a>. If there is any inconsistency between
            any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control
            unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally
            fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the
            arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although
            arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the
            same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law.
            Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
          </div>
          <div class="body-12M">
            Unless Networked LLC and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both
            parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
            location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000.00 or less, Networked LLC agrees that you may choose whether
            the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an
            in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000/00, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
            Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to
            explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

            Networked LLC or you under the AAA Rules, Networked LLC and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to
            the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for
            any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Networked LLC will pay your portion of such fees.
