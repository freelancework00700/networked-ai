          participation in a commercial activity (e.g., offer to purchase a product, advertise or promote a product). Its key feature requires
          organizations that send CEMs within, from, or to Canada to receive consent from the consumer before sending messages. Consent can be
          obtained either explicitly or implicitly.
        </div>

          Examples of explicit consent include but are not limited to signing up for our mailing list online, entering sweepstakes and contests, and

          product; implied consent is considered valid for 24 months following the purchase of a product, and 6 months following an inquiry about a
          product.

          can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
