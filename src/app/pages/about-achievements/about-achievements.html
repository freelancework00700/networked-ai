      <div class="body-14M desc">
        On Networked AI, the more you show up, the more you stand out. We're here to celebrate your influence as you grow your network, host events,
        connect with others, and leave your mark in the community.
      </div>

      <div class="body-16SB">What's the Networked Level Score?</div>

      <div>
        <div class="body-14R desc">Your Networked Level Score reflects your overall activity and engagement across five core areas:</div>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside body-14R pl-4 desc">
          <li>Events Hosted 🎤</li>
          <li>Events Attended 🎟</li>
          <li>Connections Made 🤝</li>
          <li>QR Code Scans 📲</li>
          <li>Messages Sent 💬</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="body-14M desc">
        Each category contributes up to <span class="font-bold text-black">10,000 points,</span> for a total score of
        <span class="font-bold text-black">50,000 possible points.</span> The more active you are, the more influence you build — and the more
        exclusive badges you unlock.
      </div>

      <div class="body-14M desc">
        Each action earns you points. As your points add up, so does your influence, visibility, and credibility. You don't need to be famous —
        <span class="font-bold text-black">you just need to keep showing up.</span>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="body-16SB">How You Earn Points</div>
        <div class="body-14M desc">Here's how actions translate into progress:</div>

          That means your total <span class="font-bold">Networked Level Score</span> can reach
          <span class="font-bold">50,000 points.</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="body-14M desc">

        you're someone worth connecting with.
